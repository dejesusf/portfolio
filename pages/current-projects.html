            <p>Personally, I've always enjoyed fill-in puzzles over crossword puzzles because I simply did not have expanded knowledge base to complete one. I haven't seen any website that have Pokemon themed fill-in puzzles yet either! </p>
            <p><strong>Plan:</strong> I'd have to do additional research to see if there is already a database/API that holds all information on moves, types, Pokemon, and locations. Otherwise, that might be something I'd have to create and then use for this project. Obviously the puzzles would be interactive. I would prefer to build this using MySQL but am open to use MongoDB if I have to.</p>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Create an application that puzzlers would enjoy that are Pokemon themed. </p>
